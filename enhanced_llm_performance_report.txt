IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
=======================
1. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
   → Selective deployment based on task requirements
2. QUALITY MONITORING:
   → Implement A/B testing for quality validation
   → Monitor task-specific performance metrics
3. COST OPTIMIZATION:
   → Potential annual savings: 8% of LLM costs
   → ROI positive for >1000 requests/month
4. HYBRID APPROACH:
   → Use opcodes for: explanation, output prediction
   → Use source for: optimization, bug detection
